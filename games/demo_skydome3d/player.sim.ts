// The row one seat possesses: the eye it flies over the flat sand under the sky, which the camera sits
// on (chasecamera3d, `dist` metres behind it). `addons/player` spawns it and writes the slot it gave
// the connection into `seat`, and every seat is sent it. A page running the scene ahead
// (`addons/predict`) draws its own from its copy, so the eye answers the key on the next frame. Every
// number is the player's definition in `assets/demo_skydome3d.json`.
//
// The row: `seat`, and `stood`, whether it stands yet. Its own:
//   pos       [x, y, z], the eye, in metres.
//   look      `{ yaw, pitch, dist }`: chasecamera3d's orbit; the eye looks along yaw and down by pitch.
//   lift      0: the camera's pivot is the eye itself.
//   stick     [x, z], the keys' way, right and forward; `up` and `down`, the climb keys held; `fast`,
//             the boost key held.
//   pace      the fly speed's multiplier, which the wheel moves, from `pace.min` to `pace.max`.
//
// `before` stands it once on the scene's `start` actor for its slot, `up` metres over the ground at the
// start's `at`, looking along its `yaw` and down by its `pitch`. Each step after, it flies `speed`·pace
// metres a second along the way it looks, forward and back, and across it, level, right and left, and
// `climb`·pace straight up or down; all of it `boost` times faster while `fast` is held. It never comes
// nearer than `clear` metres to the ground, the plane y = 0, nor goes higher than `ceiling` or further
// than `reach` from the middle.
//
// The acts are the page's keys: `stick(x, y)` (y down, as a stick reads), `up`, `down` and `fast` (1
// held, 0 let go), `pace(d)` the wheel, `look(dyaw, dpitch)`. A seat's message arrives from outside the
// program, so each act refuses arguments of the wrong kind and writes nothing.
